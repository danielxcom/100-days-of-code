*January 20, 2018* | **1** | Mulled over the D3 architectures my Udemy course provided. 1. General-Update-Pattern, 2. Force-Link, 3. Advanced function calls for setting up distance between nodes or arrangement of data on graphs. 
--- | --- | ---
*January 21, 2018* | **2** | Learned React basics.
--- | --- | ---
*January 22, 2018* | **3-10** | Focused on react state-changing / arrow functions / pointers.
--- | --- | ---
*January 31, 2018* | **11** | State needs to be rectified in a singular component. We use arrow functions for render methods incase we need to change things dynamically without disrupting state.
--- | --- | ---
*February 1, 2018* | **12** | Code-alonged with Udemy Instructor. Built page with 32 div boxes that randomly switched colors every 300 m/s.
--- | --- | ---
*February 2, 2018* | **13** | Don't accidentally invoke your callback functions inside of your eventhandlers. <button type="button" onClick={this.handleClick()}> Will cause error. Use arrow functions for internal eyword this. Or bind. It is important to render multiple list ele with [e.target...] architecture found in file when handling multiple items.
--- | --- | ---
*February 3, 2018* | **14** | Understand how to implement state with forms. Refactored previous recipeList.
--- | --- | ---
*February 4, 2018* | **15-17** | Tried / Failed to implement my own memory game with react. Finalized understanding in state comparison, utilizing bool for on/off functionality, setting 16 cards into HIDING, SHOWING, MATCHING internal states, creating ternary conditions that deduced 2 matching, 2 non-matching, 2 hiding, etc., leaving MATCHING cards viewable after finding them, utilizing reset feature in NavBar, setting parent state, used a shuffle array npm install for refresh.

--- | --- | ---
*February 11, 2018* | **22** | Refactored Memory game + LifeCycle section.
--- | --- | ---
*February 12, 2018* | **23** | Read documentation / watched YT videos on React's Diff algo / shouldComponentUpdate component so we can exit from Update cycle if there is no reason to re-render. 
--- | --- | ---
*February 13, 2018* | **24-25** | Read Chap-1 & Chap-2 React Cookbook by Stan Bershadskiy
--- | --- | ---
*SKIP 10 DAYS for family matters*
--- | --- | ---
